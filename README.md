# 💲💱 Dynamic Pricing Model for Dance Studio

## 🧠 Overview
A dynamic pricing model designed for an Urban K-pop dance studio struggling with customer retention and ROI. The project aims to optimize pricing tiers to balance profit and customer acquisition.

## ❓ Problem Statement
The studio had fixed pricing that didn’t reflect customer willingness to pay. This limited profit potential and caused customer drop-offs.

## 🔍 Approach & Methodology
- Synthesized transactional customer data
- Engineered behavioral features like frequency of visits and payment habits
- Performed correlation and variance analysis
- Trained Random Forest model to predict optimal price brackets
- Analyzed feature importance to support business recommendations

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Random Forest, Scikit-learn

## 📈 Results
- Generated a dynamic pricing scheme that improved projected profit margins
- Identified key behavioral traits that influence payment behavior
- Visualized customer segments and price sensitivities

## 💡 What I Learned
- Simulating business scenarios and modeling with synthetic data
- Building interpretable models using feature importance
- Connecting data insights to business strategy

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Add time-based dynamic factors (e.g., weekday/weekend pricing)
- Build a Streamlit interface for the pricing tool


### Detailed Project Background
  > The K-pop dance industry has experienced remarkable growth, drawing in diverse audiences ranging from beginners to seasoned dancers eager to learn K-pop choreography across regions. Urban K-pop Dance has strategically positioned itself in this space by offering dance classes led by expert instructors to participants of various skill levels and an online booking system for classes. 
The industry experiences unique fluctuations in demand in urban areas and is competitive; hence, requiring businesses to constantly analyze and understand factors like pricing, location, instructor expertise, and evolving consumer preferences to fully capitalize on market opportunities and respond effectively to fluctuating demand. A well-optimized pricing model is essential for sustaining demand and profitability.
To address this challenge, this project aims to develop an AI-powered dynamic pricing model tailored to Urban K-pop Dance's unique operational environment. The project seeks to optimize revenue generation by leveraging machine learning techniques while ensuring pricing remains accessible and customer centric. Through a robust data analytics-based research approach, the study integrates data from class enrollments, sales trends, instructor expertise, and demographic factors to identify the variables most influential to pricing.
This dynamic pricing strategy not only provides a competitive edge by adapting to market conditions but also enhances customer satisfaction through personalized and equitable pricing.
