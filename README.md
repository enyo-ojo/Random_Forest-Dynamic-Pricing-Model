# Dynamic-Pricing-Model
  - BUILDING A DYNAMIC AI PRICING MODEL FOR URBAN K-POP DANCE
  > The K-pop dance industry has experienced remarkable growth, drawing in diverse audiences ranging from beginners to seasoned dancers eager to learn K-pop choreography across regions. Urban K-pop Dance has strategically positioned itself in this space by offering dance classes led by expert instructors to participants of various skill levels and an online booking system for classes. 
The industry experiences unique fluctuations in demand in urban areas and is competitive; hence, requiring businesses to constantly analyze and understand factors like pricing, location, instructor expertise, and evolving consumer preferences to fully capitalize on market opportunities and respond effectively to fluctuating demand. A well-optimized pricing model is essential for sustaining demand and profitability.
To address this challenge, this project aims to develop an AI-powered dynamic pricing model tailored to Urban K-pop Dance's unique operational environment. The project seeks to optimize revenue generation by leveraging machine learning techniques while ensuring pricing remains accessible and customer centric. Through a robust data analytics-based research approach, the study integrates data from class enrollments, sales trends, instructor expertise, and demographic factors to identify the variables most influential to pricing.
This dynamic pricing strategy not only provides a competitive edge by adapting to market conditions but also enhances customer satisfaction through personalized and equitable pricing.
